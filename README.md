# TallyCase-USB-Capture  

**TallyCase-USB-Capture** is a 3D-printable housing designed to upgrade a standard USB capture card.  
This project extends existing capture card enclosures by adding:  

- 📸 **Cold shoe mount** for cameras/phones  
- 💡 **Tally light support** using ESP32/ESP8266  
- ❄️ **Cooling fan integration** for better thermal management  

The goal is to provide a **modular, durable, and maker-friendly case** that combines video capture with useful add-ons for streaming and recording setups.

### ✅ Pros
- Provides a neat mounting solution for cameras and phones.  
- Cold shoe integration makes it easy to attach accessories.  

### ⚠️ Cons
- Current design may not handle additional weight (ESP32/ESP8266 board, cooling fan).  
- Long-term durability concerns due to stress on the base.  
- Susceptible to damage from rough handling (pushing/pulling, accidental hits).  

### 🔧 Requirements (Must-Haves for Modification)
- Reinforce the base to support extra hardware weight.  
- Add structural support for a cooling fan mount.  
- Ensure stability when used with a capture card + additional electronics.
